# Continuous Deployment Pipeline for Microservice and Serverless Application

This project implements a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate the building, testing, and deployment of a hybrid application comprising microservices and serverless components into a Kubernetes cluster and a serverless platform (e.g., AWS Lambda).

## Project Overview

This project implements a CI/CD pipeline for an e-commerce platform consisting of microservices (User, Product, Order, Frontend) and serverless components (Order Function, Notification Function). The pipeline automates building, testing, and deployment to a Kubernetes cluster and AWS Lambda.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following in place:

- AWS account with the necessary permissions
- Terraform installed
- Docker installed
- Jenkins server set up
- Knowledge of Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, and AWS Lambda

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Define Infrastructure with Terraform

- Create a Terraform directory.
- Define your AWS infrastructure, including VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, RDS instances, and IAM roles for serverless components.
- Define your Kubernetes cluster using EKS or the method of your choice.

### Step 2: Create Docker Images

- Create Dockerfiles for each microservice (User, Product, Order, Frontend).
- Build Docker images for each microservice and push them to an Amazon ECR registry.

### Step 3: Set Up Jenkins for CI/CD

- Launch a Jenkins server, either on an EC2 instance or in a Docker container.
- Install and configure Jenkins plugins for AWS and Docker integration.
- Set up Jenkins pipeline jobs for each microservice and serverless component.
- Define Jenkinsfiles for each pipeline job.

### Step 4: Configure CI/CD Pipeline

- Configure the CI/CD pipeline to trigger on code changes in your version control system (e.g., Git).
- Define pipeline stages for each service, including building, testing, and deployment.

### Step 5: Test and Deploy Microservices

- Develop comprehensive tests for your microservices (unit tests, integration tests, etc.).
- Use Jenkins to deploy your microservices to the Kubernetes cluster.

### Step 6: Test and Deploy Serverless Components

- Package and deploy your serverless components (Order Function, Notification Function) using Jenkins.
- Verify proper integration with other services and external APIs.

### Step 7: Integrate the Frontend

- Configure the Frontend service to interact with microservices and serverless functions.
- Update the Jenkins pipeline for the Frontend to include build and deployment steps.

### Step 8: Continuous Monitoring and Feedback

- Implement monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., CloudWatch, ELK stack) to track application performance and health.
- Set up alerts for anomalies or issues.

### Step 9: Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

- Document the entire pipeline, infrastructure setup, and configurations.
- Share knowledge within the team to enable future maintenance and improvement.

### Step 10: Maintenance and Updates

- Regularly maintain and update your infrastructure, Docker images, Kubernetes configurations, and serverless functions for security, stability, and scalability.
